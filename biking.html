              Amsterdam is the perfect city to ride around on a bicycle. It is a
              well known city for being bike friendly. Some would consider it
              the most famous biking city in the world. There are actually more
              bikes than people in Amsterdam. On top of this there are nearly 2
              million electric e-bikes on the road, which have been quickly
              gaining popularity, particularly amongst the elderly. The country
              is extremely flat which is partially why biking is so popular. On
              a work day early in the morning there could be as many as two
              million bikers on the road throughout the Netherlands. Many people
              will own two bikes, one more run down bike for everyday use and
              another nicer one for touring.
